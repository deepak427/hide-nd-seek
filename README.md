# Hide & Seek - Interactive Object Finding Game

A sophisticated hide-and-seek puzzle game built with Phaser.js for Reddit's Devvit platform. Challenge your observation skills by finding hidden objects in beautifully crafted virtual scenes, or create your own challenges for the community to solve!

## üéÆ What is Hide & Seek?

Hide & Seek is an innovative social puzzle game that transforms the classic childhood game into an engaging digital experience. Players create hiding challenges by directly clicking on objects in virtual environments to hide behind them, then share these challenges as interactive Reddit posts. Other players discover hidden objects by clicking throughout the scene, receiving real-time feedback and earning rank progression based on their detective skills.

**Core Innovation**: This game features a streamlined "click-to-hide" mechanic where players simply click directly on any object in the scene to hide behind it. The game uses precise position tracking with normalized coordinates (0.000-1.000) to ensure pixel-perfect placement across all devices. When others play your challenge, they must find the hidden object by clicking on interactive objects scattered throughout the scene.

## üéØ Game Summary

Hide & Seek is a fully functional, sophisticated puzzle game that brings the classic childhood game into the digital age with modern web technologies. Built with Phaser.js and designed for Reddit's Devvit platform, it features:

**Core Gameplay**: Players click directly on objects (pumpkin, wardrobe, bush, car, truck, guard) to hide behind them, then share challenges as Reddit posts. Other players find hidden objects by clicking on interactive elements scattered throughout the scene.

**Technical Innovation**: The game uses precise position tracking with normalized coordinates (0.000-1.000), intelligent asset management with fallback textures, and a 4-tier performance optimization system. It seamlessly operates in both standalone and embedded Reddit modes.

**Social Features**: Progressive rank system (Tyapu ‚Üí GuessMaster ‚Üí Detective ‚Üí FBI), creator dashboards with real-time analytics, and automatic Reddit post generation for community challenges.

The game is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, mobile optimization, and a complete scene flow from splash screen to interactive gameplay.
