# Hide & Seek - Interactive Object Finding Game

A sophisticated hide-and-seek puzzle game built with Phaser.js for Reddit's Devvit platform. Create hiding challenges by clicking on objects in virtual scenes, then share them as interactive Reddit posts for the community to solve!

## üéÆ What is Hide & Seek?

Hide & Seek is an innovative social puzzle game that transforms the classic childhood game into an engaging digital experience. Players create hiding challenges by clicking on objects in virtual environments, then share these challenges as interactive Reddit posts. Other players find hidden objects by clicking on the same objects in the scene, receiving real-time feedback and earning rank progression.

**Core Innovation**: This game features a streamlined "click-to-hide" mechanic where players simply click directly on any object in the scene to hide behind it. The game uses precise position tracking with normalized coordinates (0.000-1.000) to ensure pixel-perfect placement across all devices. When others play your challenge, they must find the hidden object by clicking on the same interactive objects positioned throughout the scene.

## üéØ What This Game Actually Does

### Revolutionary Social Gaming Experience

Hide & Seek transforms the classic childhood game into a modern, social digital experience. Unlike traditional hidden object games where you search for predetermined items, this game lets **you create the challenges**. You become both the hider and the seeker, creating puzzles for others while solving challenges created by the community.

**The Innovation**: Instead of searching through cluttered scenes for tiny objects, players engage in strategic gameplay by choosing where to hide behind clearly visible, interactive objects. The challenge isn't finding something small and obscure‚Äîit's thinking like your opponent and predicting where they might choose to hide.

## üéØ Complete Game Experience

### Complete Hide-and-Seek Experience

## üéÆ Game Mechanics Explained

### The Core Concept
This isn't about finding tiny hidden objects in cluttered scenes. Instead, it's about **strategic thinking and psychology**:

1. **As the Hider**: You choose one of 6 clearly visible objects (pumpkin, wardrobe, bush, car, truck, guard) to hide behind. Your challenge is to pick the object that others are least likely to guess first.

2. **As the Seeker**: You see the same 6 objects and must guess which one the hider chose. You get feedback on how close you were, making each guess a learning experience.

3. **The Strategy**: Success comes from understanding human psychology‚Äîwhere would someone choose to hide? What objects look most appealing? Which locations seem too obvious or too obscure?

### Why This Works
- **Clear Visual Design**: All interactive objects are clearly visible and distinctly styled with hover effects
- **Strategic Depth**: Limited choices (6 objects) create meaningful decisions rather than random searching  
- **Social Learning**: Each guess teaches you about how other players think and choose hiding spots
- **Immediate Feedback**: Distance-based hints help you improve your guessing strategy over time
- **Community Building**: Creating challenges for others builds engagement and social connection

### Technical Excellence
- **Pixel-Perfect Accuracy**: Uses normalized coordinates (0.000-1.000) for consistent gameplay across all devices
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers
- **Smart Performance**: 4-tier optimization system ensures smooth gameplay on any device
- **Reddit Integration**: Seamlessly works within Reddit's ecosystem for maximum social reach

### Object Locations & Strategy
**Outdoor Objects (Top half of map):**
- **Bush**: Hidden in the ground/field area (top-left) - Natural camouflage
- **Pumpkin**: Placed on the veranda/deck (top-center) - Seasonal and obvious
- **Car**: Parked on the road (top-right) - Common but expected
- **Truck**: Also on the road (top-right) - Larger, more noticeable

**Indoor Objects (Bottom half of map):**
- **Guard**: Standing at the hall entrance (bottom-center) - Human element, unpredictable
- **Wardrobe**: Located in the side hall (bottom-left) - Classic hiding spot, might be too obvious

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **Psychology**: What would most players choose first? Avoid the obvious.
- **Reverse Psychology**: Sometimes the most obvious choice is overlooked.
- **Location Balance**: Indoor vs outdoor preferences vary by player.
- **Object Size**: Larger objects (truck, wardrobe) vs smaller ones (pumpkin, bush).
